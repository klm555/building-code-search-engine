Floor and roof\nframing is stiff, including cast-in-place concrete slabs or metal deck with concrete ﬁll supported on\nsteel beams, open web joists, or steel trusses. Seismic forces are resisted by steel moment framesthat develop their stiffness through rigid or semirigid beam –column connections. Where all\nconnections are moment-resisting connections, the entire frame participates in seismic forceresistance. Where only selected connections are moment-resisting connections, resistance isprovided along discrete frame lines. Columns are oriented so that each principal direction of thebuilding has columns resisting forces in strong axis bending. Diaphragms consist of rigidconstruction that is stiff relative to the frames. The exterior of the structure is permitted to beconcealed; the environmental closure walls consist of any type, including both ductile, ﬂexible\nsystems, and rigid, nonductile systems (e.g., unreinforced masonry either interior or exterior to theframe line).

Braced frames develop\nresistance to seismic forces by the bracing action of the diagonal members. The braces induceforces in the associated beams and columns such that all elements work together in a mannersimilar to a truss; all element stresses are primarily axial. Diaphragms transfer seismic loads tobraced frames. The diaphragms consist of concrete or metal deck with concrete ﬁll and are stiff\nrelative to the frames. The foundation system is permitted to consist of a variety of elements.Three variations in the con ﬁguration and design of braced frames exist. These variations are\n\x81Concentrically braced frames: Component work lines intersect at a single point or at multiple\npoints such that the distance between intersecting work lines (or eccentricity) is less than orequal to the width of the smallest component connected at the joint.\ncontinues\n30 STANDARD ASCE/SEI 41-17\n\n\x81Eccentrically braced frames: Component work lines do not intersect at a single point, and the\ndistance between the intersecting work lines (or eccentricity) exceeds the width of the smallestcomponent connecting at the joint.

They are one story high, but they\nsometimes have mezzanines. The roof and walls consist of lightweight metal, ﬁberglass, or\ncementitious panels. The frames are designed for maximum ef ﬁciency, and the beams and\ncolumns are permitted to consist of either web-tapered or prismatic built-up sections with thinplates. The frames are built in segments and assembled in the ﬁeld with bolted or welded\njoints. Seismic forces in the transverse direction are resisted by the moment frames.

The ﬂoor and roof\ndiaphragms consist of cast-in-place concrete slabs or metal deck with or without concrete ﬁll.\nFraming consists of steel beams, open web joists, or steel trusses. Seismic forces are resistedprimarily by either steel braced frames or constructed-in-place shear walls in combination withbackup steel moment frames. These walls are bearing walls where the steel frame does notprovide a complete vertical support system. The steel moment frames are designed to worktogether with the steel braced frames or concrete shear walls in proportion to their relative rigidity.The steel moment frames provide a secondary seismic-force-resisting system based on thestiffness of the frame and the moment capacity of the beam –column connections. Such moment\nframes were typically designed to be capable of resisting 25% of the building ’s seismic forces.

In ﬁll walls are permitted to completely encase the\nframe members and present a smooth masonry ext erior with no indication of the frame. The\nseismic performance of this type of constructi on depends on the interaction between the frame\nand in ﬁll panels. The combined behavior is more like a shear wall structure than a frame\nstructure. Solidly in ﬁlled masonry panels form diagonal compression struts between the\nintersections of the frame members. If the walls are offset from the frame and do not fullyengage the frame members, diagonal compression struts do not develop. The strength of theinﬁll panel is limited by the shear capacity of the masonry bed joint or the compression capacity\nof the strut.

(61 cm) apart, wood or cold-formed steel trusses,\nstructural steel or cold-formed steel beams, and st ructural steel or cold-formed steel columns.\nThe ﬁrst-ﬂoor framing is supported directly on the fo undation system or is raised up on cripple\nstuds and post-and-beam supports. The foundat ion is permitted to consist of a variety of\nelements. Chimneys, where present, consist of solid brick masonry, masonry veneer, or cold-formed steel frame with internal metal ﬂues. Seismic forces are resisted by diaphragms with\nwood structural panels or metal deck, and walls with diagonal ﬂat strap bracing. Floor and roof\nsheathing consists of wood structural panels or metal deck. Interior surfaces are sheathed withplaster or gypsum board. Buildings of this type that have precast concrete plank diaphragms shallnot be permitted to be classi ﬁed as this common building type and shall not be permitted to be\nevaluated using Tier 1 or Tier 2 procedures.\nConcrete Moment Frames\nC1 These buildings consist of a frame assembly of cast-in-place concrete beams and columns. Floor\nand roof framing consists of cast-in-place conc rete slabs, concrete beams, one-way joists, two-\nway waf ﬂe joists, or ﬂat slabs. Seismic forces are resisted by concrete moment frames that\ndevelop their stiffness through monolithic beam –column connections. In older construction, or in\nlevels of low seismicity, the moment frames are permitted to consist of the column strips of two-way ﬂat slab systems. Modern frames in levels of high seismicity have joint reinforcing, closely\nspaced ties, and special detailing to provide ductile performance. This detailing is usually notpresent in older construction. The foundation system is permitted to consist of a variety ofelements.\nConcrete Shear Walls\nC2(with Stiff Diaphragms)These buildings have ﬂoor and roof framing that consists of cast-in-place concrete slabs,\nconcrete beams, one-way joists, two-way waf ﬂe joists, or ﬂat slabs. Buildings may also have\nsteel beams, steel columns, cold-formed steel light-frame construction, and concrete slabs forthe gravity framing. Floors are supported on concrete columns or bearing walls. Seismic forcesare resisted by cast-in-place concrete shear walls. In older construction, shear walls arelightly reinforced but often extend throughout the building. In more recent construction, shearwalls occur in isolated locations, are more heavily reinforced, and have concrete slabs thatare stiff relative to the walls. The foundation system is permitted to consist of a variety ofelements.\nC2a(with Flexible Diaphragms)These buildings are similar to C2 buildings, except that diaphragms consist of wood sheathing, or\nhave large aspect ratios, and are ﬂexible relative to the walls.\ncontinues\n32 STANDARD ASCE/SEI 41-17\n\nConcrete Frames with In ﬁll Masonry Shear Walls\nC3(with Stiff Diaphragms)This is an older type of building construction that consists of a frame assembly of cast-in-place\nconcrete beams and columns. The ﬂoor and roof diaphragms consist of cast-in-place concrete\nslabs and are stiff relative to the walls. Walls consist of in ﬁll panels constructed of solid clay brick,\nconcrete block, or hollow clay tile masonry. The seismic performance of this type of constructiondepends on the interaction between the frame and the in ﬁll panels. The combined behavior is more\nlike a shear wall structure than a frame structure. Solidly in ﬁlled masonry panels form diagonal\ncompression struts between the intersections of the frame members. If the walls are offset from theframe and do not fully engage the frame members, the diagonal compression struts do not develop.The strength of the in ﬁll panel is limited by the shear capacity of the masonry bed joint or the\ncompression capacity of the strut. The postcracking strength is determined by an analysis of a\nmoment frame that is partially restrained by the cracked in ﬁll. The shear strength of the concrete\ncolumns, after racking of the in ﬁll, is permitted to be limited by the semiductile behavior of the\nsystem. The foundation system is permitted to consist of a variety of elements.\nC3a(with Flexible Diaphragms)These buildings are similar to C3 buildings, except that diaphragms are ﬂexible and consist of\nwood sheathing or untopped metal deck or have large aspect ratios and are ﬂexible relative to the\nwalls.\nPrecast or Tilt-Up Concrete Shear Walls\nPC1(with Flexible Diaphragms)These buildings have precast concrete perimeter wall panels and often, interior walls, that are\ntypically cast on site and tilted into place. The panels are interconnected by weldments, cast-in-place concrete pilasters, or collector elements. Floor and roof framing consists of wood joists,glulam beams, steel beams, or open web joists. Framing is supported on interior steel or woodcolumns and perimeter concrete bearing walls. The ﬂoors and roof consist of wood sheathing or\nuntopped metal deck. Seismic forces are resisted by the precast concrete perimeter wall panels.Wall panels are permitted to be solid or have large window and door openings that cause thepanels to behave more as frames than as shear walls. In older construction, wood framing isattached to the walls with wood ledgers. The roof framing is permitted to have tension-capableconnections between elements. The foundation system is permitted to consist of a variety ofelements.\nPC1a(with Stiff Diaphragms)These buildings are similar to PC1 buildings, except that diaphragms consist of precast elements,\ncast-in-place concrete, or metal deck with concrete ﬁll and are stiff relative to the walls.\nPrecast Concrete Frames\nPC2(with Shear Walls)These buildings consist of a frame assembly of precast concrete girders and columns with the\npresence of shear walls. Floor and roof framing consists of precast concrete planks, tees, ordouble-tees supported on precast concrete girders and columns, some or all of which are permittedto be pre- or post-tensioned. Seismic forces are resisted by precast or cast-in-place concrete shearwalls, which are permitted to also bear gravity loads. Diaphragms consist of precast elementsinterconnected with welded inserts, cast-in-place closure strips, or reinforced concrete toppingslabs. The foundation system is permitted to consist of a variety of elements.\nPC2a(without Shear Walls)These buildings are similar to PC2 buildings, except that concrete shear walls are not present.\nSeismic forces are resisted by precast concrete moment frames that develop their stiffness throughbeam –column joints rigidly connected by welded inserts or cast-in-place concrete closures.\nDiaphragms consist of precast elements interconnected with welded inserts, cast-in-place closurestrips, or reinforced concrete topping slabs. The foundation system is permitted to consist of avariety of elements.\nReinforced Masonry Bearing Walls with Flexible Diaphragms\nRM1 These buildings have bearing walls that consist of reinforced brick or concrete block masonry.\nThe ﬂoor and roof framing consists of steel or wood beams and girders, cold-formed steel light-\nframe construction, or open web joists and are supported by steel, wood, or masonry columns.Seismic forces are resisted by the reinforced brick or concrete block masonry shear walls.Diaphragms consist of straight or diagonal wood sheathing, plywood, or untopped metal deckand are ﬂexible relative to the walls.
